    <p> "To get a job in Kenya, it is not about being smart or hard-working. We say, 'You have to know someone"
    
            Yet, as corruption continues to factor into almost all economic transactions here, the clamor for change keeps growing.
            
            While Kenya's economy still creates jobs and state institutions are functional, if inefficient, corruption has become so deeply
             rooted that a 2016 survey of young people by one of the country's best universities found that half of respondents did not care 
             how they made their money, as long as they did not end up in jail. 
            
             Companies report that irregular payments and bribes in the process of tax payments are very common (GCR 2015-2016). 
            
             enyans report a high likelihood of bribery demands in meetings with land service officials, and 
             corrupt practices reportedly occur in almost 20% of all interactions
            
             this is a major reason why poverty is such a problem and why the slums in Nairobi are so devastatingly poor in quality and why the lives of the people in these slums are so bad. 
             
              Nairobi, the impact of this corruption on the urban poor has been devastating. Poverty in Nairobi means extreme food
              shortages and a lack of basic resources. The burden of this has disproportionately been inflicted upon those who dwell in
               Nairobi's sprawling and overpopulated slums.
